L&Aser Public Use License (Based on SSPL v1)
Version 1.0 â€” April 2025
Copyright (c) 2025 Laudando & Associates LLC

Section 1. Purpose
This License governs the use of the Alpha version only of the L&Aser firmware, control software, and associated AI models ("L&Aser Software") as well as associated system designs published under this license. It is designed to allow free use by independent growers, academic researchers, and non-commercial entities, while ensuring that commercial exploitation requires a separate paid commercial license.

This license does NOT apply to:
- Any AgCeptionâ„¢ branded software, hardware, or subsystems
- The L&Aser Beta or Beta+ modules (current versions)
These remain proprietary and are available ONLY under commercial license.

Section 2. Terms and Conditions

1. License Grant
   You are granted the rights to use, modify, and redistribute the Alpha version of the L&Aser Software under the conditions outlined in this license.

2. Commercial Use Restriction
   If you make the L&Aser Software or any modified version available to third parties as part of a service (e.g., field robotics, automated weeding systems, or decision-support platforms), you must release the entire source code of your system under this same license, including but not limited to:
   - All orchestration and scheduling systems
   - All telemetry and data aggregation services
   - All integration code used to embed the L&Aser Software into hardware systems
   - Any firmware, control loops, diagnostics, or visualization layers

3. Prohibited Circumvention
   You may not use containers, wrappers, or proxy APIs to avoid sharing code that would otherwise be required under this license.

4. Anti-Reverse Engineering Clause
   You may not use, analyze, disassemble, decompile, or otherwise reverse engineer the L&Aser Software, firmware, or reference designs for the purpose of:
   - Building a functionally similar or competitive product
   - Re-implementing proprietary optimizations or integration techniques
   - Circumventing the obligations of this license through technical substitution or abstraction
   - Creating derivative works intended for commercial exploitation under a different license

5. Branding and Certification
   Use of the L&Aserâ„¢ name, branding, certification logos, or affiliation with Laudando & Associates LLC is not granted under this license and requires separate authorization.

6. Hardware Reference Designs
   Reference hardware designs are governed separately by the CERN OHL v2-S. Commercial use of hardware derived from these designs must comply with that license, and the combination of such hardware with L&Aser Software constitutes a system subject to the terms herein.

7. Patents and Trade Secrets
   No license is granted to any proprietary patents or trade secrets of Laudando & Associates LLC except as necessary to use the Alpha version of the L&Aser Software in its unmodified, open-source form.

8. Kill Switch Clause
   In the event that a commercial entity engages in legal action, embargo, patent trolling, or other bad-faith behavior designed to suppress, delay, or disable the L&Aser platform:
   - Laudando & Associates LLC reserves the right to release all proprietary modules and internal IP of the L&Aser system under this license, nullifying exclusivity and triggering a global commons.

Section 3. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE.

Section 4. Termination
This license is automatically terminated if you fail to comply with any of its terms. Termination does not relieve you of the obligations to disclose your source code under the scope of prior use.

Section 5. Commercial Licensing
If you wish to:
- Use the L&Aser Software in a proprietary system
- Embed it in a commercial agricultural product
- Offer it as part of a paid field service

You must obtain a commercial license from:
Laudando & Associates LLC
